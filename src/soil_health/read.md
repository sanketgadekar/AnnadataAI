🎯 Objective (Write this in your project)

“Build a Soil Health Check system that analyzes soil parameters and outputs soil health status, nutrient deficiencies, and actionable recommendations for farmers.”

🔍 Inputs (What the system accepts)

For Version 1, lock these inputs (don’t add more yet):

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

pH

Soil Moisture

These are:

Available in datasets

Understandable in interviews

Sufficient for meaningful output

📤 Outputs (What the system must produce)

Your system must output exactly these 4 things:

Soil Health Score (0–100)

Soil Health Class

Healthy

Moderate

Poor

Nutrient Deficiency Report

Basic Recommendation (fertilizer / soil treatment)
